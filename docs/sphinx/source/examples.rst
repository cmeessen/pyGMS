Jupyter notebook
----------------

The contents of the :ref:`computations` and :ref:`visualisation` sections is
also available as a jupyter notebook `here <../examples/Example.ipynb>`_.


Terminal application
--------------------

In this example I used :mod:`pyGMS` as a terminal application such that it can
be used within other bash scripts to auto-generate profiles. This is the
content of the ``profile.sh`` which is executable in bash:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/plot_profile.sh
    :language: bash

The content of the ``profile.py`` is:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/plot_profile.py
    :language: python
