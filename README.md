pyGMS is a Python 3 module designed to analyse the rheological behaviour of
lithosphere-scale 3D structural models that were created with the
[GeoModellingSystem](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/basin-modeling/infrastructure/gms/) (GMS, GFZ Potsdam). It was originally written for the
purpose of plotting yield strength envelope cross sections during my PhD.
